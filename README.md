FreeCAD is a parametric 3D modeler. Parametric modeling
allows you to easily modify your design by going back into
your model history and changing its parameters. FreeCAD is
open source (LGPL license) and completely modular, allowing
for very advanced extension and customization.

FreeCAD is multiplatfom, and reads and writes many open
file formats such as STEP, IGES, STL and others.
